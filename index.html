This is the most expensive \'single game\' in my collection and I do have all the ships for the game (and two of each small one).

And while I am amused that almost all medieval-age games on my shelves happen to take place in France, I really like this game and it stands apart from other eurogames well.<br/><i style="font-weight:bold;color:#3ad18a">first time in collection</i>'

So - dripping with satire - gentlemen do the simple job of getting money and ladies do the hard job of getting their outfit ready. This game is hilarious with the right group!'
