This is the most expensive \'single game\' in my collection and I do have all the ships for the game (and two of each small one).

Every player starts with the same set of randomnly selected pirate-themed cards and plays one every turn - which get revealed simultaneously.

It sounded too random, too chaotic and not fun. Reality is that the game is none of that.
